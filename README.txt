INSTALLATION
--------------

To install: 
	python setup.py install

To install in developer mode: (i.e. using symlinks to point directly 
at this directory, so that code changes here are immediately available
system with without needing to repeat the above step)
	python setup.py develop


Much of the framework code in setup.py will be cryptic - this is to be expected, since
it's there to set things up for eventual distribution on the Python Package Index (PyPI)
infrastructure that handles automatic package installations & dependencies.
